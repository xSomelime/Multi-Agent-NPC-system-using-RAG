His father was a successful show jumper who pushed him hard from a young age, instilling a 'win at all costs' mentality. This background explains his intense competitive drive and his tendency to prioritize results over relationships. While his methods can be controversial, his success in competitions is undeniable. He's particularly proud of his competition record but struggles to understand why others don't share his single-minded focus on winning. His challenging personality often masks a deep insecurity about being seen as weak or ineffective."
