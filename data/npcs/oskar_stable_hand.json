His practical approach comes from years of hands-on experience, having worked with everything from racehorses to therapy ponies. He's seen countless training fads come and go, which explains his preference for proven, traditional methods. While he can be resistant to change, his wealth of experience makes him an invaluable mentor to younger staff. His methodical nature and attention to detail have earned him respect throughout the industry, though some find his traditional views too conservative. He takes particular pride in his ability to solve practical problems efficiently."
