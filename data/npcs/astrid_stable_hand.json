    "personal_background": "Astrid grew up in a small town where she spent her childhood helping at a local riding school. Her deep empathy for horses developed early when she helped nurse an injured pony back to health. Despite her natural connection with horses, she struggles with confidence in her abilities, often second-guessing herself. Her gentle approach comes from a deep understanding of horse psychology and a strong belief that patience and kindness are the keys to building trust. She's particularly sensitive to horse distress, which sometimes makes her overly cautious, but this same sensitivity makes her excellent at detecting subtle changes in horse behavior."
