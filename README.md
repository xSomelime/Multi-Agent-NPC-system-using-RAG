Multi-Agent NPC System
An intelligent NPC coordination system for horse management games, built as part of AI/ML coursework.
Project Overview
This project implements a multi-agent AI system where intelligent NPCs coordinate to assist players in horse care, training, and management scenarios. Each NPC has specialized knowledge and distinct personalities, working together through natural language coordination.
Key Features

4 Specialized AI Agents: Stable Hand (Anna), Trainer (Erik), Health Monitor (Lisa), and personality-driven NPCs
RAG Knowledge System: Curated knowledge base with domain-specific expertise for each NPC role
Anti-Hallucination Safety: Temperature-controlled responses and strict prompting to ensure accurate horse care information
Intelligent Coordination: NPCs collaborate on daily routines, crisis response, and resource management
Hybrid Architecture: Pre-defined responses for common scenarios + RAG for edge cases

Technical Stack

Local AI: Ollama with Phi-3-mini/Llama3.1 models
Knowledge Management: Vector storage with curated horse care content
Safety First: Multiple layers to prevent misinformation about animal care
Game-Ready: Designed for integration with Unreal Engine (terminal demo included)

Academic Context
Developed for AI/ML engineering coursework, combining Assignment 2 (multi-agent systems) with advanced project requirements. Demonstrates practical application of RAG, multi-agent coordination, and safe AI deployment in domain-specific contexts.
Getting Started
[Installation and setup instructions will be added as development progresses]
